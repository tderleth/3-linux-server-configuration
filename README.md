### Get server

-   [x]  Start a new Ubuntu Linux server instance on [Amazon Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/de/lightsail/).
-   [x]  Follow the instructions provided to SSH into your server.

### Secure server

-   [x]  Update all currently installed packages.
-   [x]  Change the SSH port from 22 to 2200. Make sure to configure the Lightsail firewall to allow it.
-   [x]  Configure the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) to only allow incoming connections for SSH (port 2200), HTTP (port 80), and NTP (port 123).

### Grader access

-   [ ]  Create a new user account named grader.
-   [ ]  Give grader the permission to sudo.
-   [ ]  Create an SSH key pair for grader using the `ssh-keygen` tool.

### Prepare to deploy your project

-   [ ]  Configure the local timezone to UTC.
-   [ ]  Install and configure Apache to serve a Python `mod_wsgi` application.
-   [ ]  Install and configure PostgreSQL (Create a new database user named catalog that has limited permissions to your catalog application database).
-   [ ]  Install git.

### Deploy Todo List project

-   [ ]  Clone and setup your Todo List project from the Github repository you created earlier in this Nanodegree program.
-   [ ]  Set it up in your server so that it functions correctly when visiting your serverâ€™s IP address in a browser. 
-   [ ]  Make sure that your .git directory is not publicly accessible via a browser!
